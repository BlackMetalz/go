var wg sync.WaitGroup 

func main() {
    // func main can be considered as a goroutine. So if you don't define any goroutines, 
    // the main function will be executed in the main goroutine. And count will be 1.


    wg.Add(2) // Add 2 to the WaitGroup counter

    go foo()
    go bar()

    wg.Wait() // Wait for the goroutine to finish
    // This will block until the WaitGroup counter is decremented to 0
    // The main goroutine will wait for the foo goroutine to finish before exiting
    // If you don't call wg.Done() in the foo function, the program will hang
    // because the main goroutine will be waiting for the foo goroutine to finish
    // and the foo goroutine will never finish because it is waiting for the main goroutine to finish
