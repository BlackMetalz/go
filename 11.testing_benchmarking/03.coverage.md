# Example about coverage in Go
Yes, that's correct! Code coverage in Go shows what percentage of your code is executed when you run your tests. Here’s a simple example you can try:

````go
package math

func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func Sub(a, b int) int {
    return a - b
}
````

````go
package math

import "testing"

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    if Add(2, 3) != 5 {
        t.Error("Add(2, 3) should be 5")
    }
}
````

Now, run this command in the 11.testing_benchmarking directory:

```sh
go test -cover
```

You’ll see output like:

```
ok  	11.testing_benchmarking	0.XXXs	coverage: 50.0% of statements
```

This is because only the `Add` function is tested, not `Sub`. If you add a test for `Sub`, coverage will increase.

# Thinking about percent of code coverage
In small examples, like the one above, 100% coverage is easy to achieve because all code paths are simple and easy to test. However, in real production environments, 100% coverage is rarely practical or necessary. Here’s why:

- **Complexity:** Production code often has many branches, error handling, and edge cases that are hard to test.
- **External dependencies:** Some code interacts with databases, networks, or external services, making it harder to test every line.
- **Generated or trivial code:** Some code (like getters/setters or auto-generated code) may not need explicit tests.
- **Diminishing returns:** After a certain point, increasing coverage takes much more effort but adds little value.

**Best practice:** Aim for high coverage (often 70–90%), but focus on testing important logic and critical paths. Coverage is a helpful metric, but not the only measure of good tests. Quality matters more than quantity.
