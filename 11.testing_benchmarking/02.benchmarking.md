# Explanation
Here’s how to read your Go benchmark output:

- **BenchmarkFast-24**:  
  - `38299459` — Number of times the benchmark ran (`b.N`).
  - `29.00 ns/op` — Average time per operation (nanoseconds per operation).

- **BenchmarkSlow-24**:  
  - `1000000` — Number of times the benchmark ran.
  - `1119 ns/op` — Average time per operation (much slower than BenchmarkFast).

**Summary:**  
- `BenchmarkFast` is much faster (29 ns/op) than `BenchmarkSlow` (1119 ns/op).
- The number after the benchmark name (e.g., `-24`) is the number of parallel goroutines used for the test.
- `PASS` means all benchmarks completed successfully.
- The final line shows the total time taken for all tests.

**Key metric:**  
- **ns/op** (nanoseconds per operation) — lower is faster.  
- Use this to compare performance between benchmarks.
