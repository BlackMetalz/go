### Little comparison
- Array used for fixed length like days of the week(7), months of the year(12). Best for optimize memory and performance usage in case we don't need to change length. Also array can be expand by create new array and copy, but this is not recommended!
- Slide is more dynamic, used for dynamic change in slide. Easy to use than Array with function append(), range.

- Demo code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Array: Need only 3 element
    arr := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
    fmt.Println("Array:", arr)

    // Slice: dynamic but had overhead
    slc := make([]int, 3) // init the slice with length = 3
    slc[0], slc[1], slc[2] = 1, 2, 3
    fmt.Println("Slice ban đầu:", slc)
    slc = append(slc, 4) // Add element, may increase memory usage!
    fmt.Println("Slice sau append:", slc)
}
```
