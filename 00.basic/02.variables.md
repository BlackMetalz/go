- Declare a varible with type
```
var varName int = 10
```

- Declare a variable without value, which mean it will be assigned to:
    - zero for int
    - "" for string
    - 0.0 for float
    - nill for pointers,functions, interfaces,slice,channels,maps

```
var varName int
```
Example print(varName)
```
0
```

- short declarion operator:
```
a := 40
```

- Use var when specificity is required
- Go is statically typed, not dynamic
- You can not have unused variable in your program
- You can't take a value that is float32 and store it in a variable that is declared to hold a VALUe of float64
```
var a float64 = 92.0
var b float32 = 92.1
// This doesn't work: can not use b (variable of type float32) as float64 value in assignment
a = b
// This does work - called convert type or conversation?
a = float64(b)
```
- The expression `T(v)` converts the value `v` to the type `T`

- Scope: You only can print variable after declare it, not before. Or you can define variable in global scope so you can call it from any function
```
print(a) // Bug
a := "WTF"
print(a) // Work
```

- Short declaration can not declare outside of function
