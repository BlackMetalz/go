### Methods.
- Example:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
	name string
}

func (p person) greet() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", p.name)
}

func main() {
	person1 := person{
		name: "Josh",
	}

	person1.greet()
}
```

Output:
```
Hello, my name is Josh
```

### Little explains
In Go, the term **receiver** refers to the variable that is used to bind a method to a specific type. It is called a receiver because it "receives" the method call. The receiver is defined in parentheses before the method name, like this:

```go
func (p person) greet() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", p.name)
}
```

###### Why is it called a receiver?
The receiver is similar to the `this` keyword in other programming languages like Java or Python, but in Go, it is explicitly declared. It allows the method to operate on the data of the type it is associated with.

In your example:
```go
func (p person) greet() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", p.name)
}
```
- `(p person)` is the **receiver**.
  - `p` is the name of the receiver variable (you can name it anything, but `p` is commonly used for brevity).
  - `person` is the type that the method is associated with.
- This means the `greet` method is tied to the `person` type, and you can call it on any instance of `person`.

---

###### How does it work?
When you call `person1.greet()`, the `person1` instance is passed as the receiver (`p`) to the `greet` method. Inside the method, you can access the fields of `person1` (like `p.name`) using the receiver variable.

---

###### Types of Receivers
1. **Value Receiver**:
   - In your example, `(p person)` is a value receiver.
   - A copy of the `person` instance is passed to the method, so any changes to `p` inside the method do not affect the original `person` instance.

2. **Pointer Receiver**:
   - If you want the method to modify the original instance, you can use a pointer receiver:
     ```go
     func (p *person) updateName(newName string) {
         p.name = newName
     }
     ```

---

###### Example with Both Receivers:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
	name string
}

// Value receiver
func (p person) greet() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", p.name)
}

// Pointer receiver
func (p *person) updateName(newName string) {
	p.name = newName
}

func main() {
	person1 := person{name: "Josh"}

	// Call greet (value receiver)
	person1.greet()

	// Call updateName (pointer receiver)
	person1.updateName("John")
	person1.greet()
}
```

**Output**:
```
Hello, my name is Josh
Hello, my name is John
```

---

###### Summary:
- The receiver `(p person)` binds the method to the `person` type.
- It is called a receiver because it "receives" the method call.
- Use a **value receiver** when you don't need to modify the original instance.
- Use a **pointer receiver** when you need to modify the original instance.
