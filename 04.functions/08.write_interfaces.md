### Introduction to Write Interface
- Example:
```go
package main

import (
	// "fmt"
	"log"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Create file
	f, err := os.Create("output.txt")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error %s", err)
	}
	// Close after everything finish executed
	defer f.Close()

	s := []byte("Hello bro!") // slice of byte, ready to write

	// Writing into file
	_, err = f.Write(s)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("error %s", err)
	}
}

```

Output: It will create new file called `output.txt` and in `output.txt` will have lines of `Hello bro!`

### Relationship between string and []bytes
- They are different but closely related and can often be converted between each other.
