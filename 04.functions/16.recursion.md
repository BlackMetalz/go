# Recursion
- a func that calls itself
- factorial example
- Recursion in programming refers to the technique of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same type.
- A recursion function is a function that calls itself during its execution.

- Example code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)


func main() {
	fmt.Println("Factorial of 4 is:", recursion(4))
	fmt.Println("Factorial of 5 is:", recursion(5))

	fmt.Println("factorialLoop of 4 is:", factorialLoop(4))
}

func recursion(n int) int {
	if n == 0 {
		return 1
	}
	return n * recursion(n-1)
}

func factorialLoop(n int) int {
	i := 1
	for n > 0 {
		i *= n
		n--
	}
	return i
}
```

Output:
```
Factorial of 4 is: 24
Factorial of 5 is: 120
factorialLoop of 4 is: 24
```
