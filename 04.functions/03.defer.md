## Key points about Defer
1. Deferred functions are executed in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order if there are multiple defer statements.
2. `defer` is often used for cleanup tasks, like closing files or releasing resources, ensuring they are executed no matter how the function exits.

Or A `defer` statement invokes a function whose execution is deferred to the moment the surrounding function return.

### defer usage
1. defer is commonly used to ensure that resources like files are closed properly, even if an error occurs
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close() // Ensures the file is closed when the function exits

    fmt.Println("File opened successfully")
    // Perform file operations here
}
```

2. Unlocking a Mutex?? No idea about mutex at this time copy this script
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

var mu sync.Mutex

func main() {
    mu.Lock()
    defer mu.Unlock() // Ensures the mutex is unlocked

    fmt.Println("Critical section")
    // Perform critical operations here
}
```

3. Timing a Function
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    start := time.Now()
    defer func() {
        duration := time.Since(start)
        fmt.Println("Execution time:", duration)
    }()

    fmt.Println("Doing some work...")
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // Simulate work
}
```

4. Releasing Resources
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    connectToDB()
}

func connectToDB() {
    fmt.Println("Connecting to database...")
    defer disconnectFromDB() // Ensures the database connection is closed

    fmt.Println("Performing database operations...")
    // Simulate database operations
}

func disconnectFromDB() {
    fmt.Println("Disconnecting from database...")
}
```

### Single defer
- Example:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer foo()
	bar()
}

func foo() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}

func bar() {
	fmt.Println("Goodbye, world!")
}
```

Output:
```
Goodbye, world!
Hello, world!
```

- Explaination: The defer statement in Go delays the execution of a function until the surrounding function (in this case, main) completes, it will execute just before the main function (or the enclosing function) returns.

### Multi defer
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer foo() // 2nd defer
    bar()       // Executes immediately
    defer baz() // 1st defer
}

func foo() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}

func bar() {
	fmt.Println("Goodbye, world!")
}

func baz() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, again!")
}
```

Output:
```
Goodbye, world!
Hello, again!
Hello, world!
```

### Other good example
You can use `defer` in **any function**, not just `main`. For example, in a function that connects to a MySQL database, you can use `defer` to ensure the database connection is properly closed when the function exits, regardless of how it exits (e.g., due to an error or normal completion).

Hereâ€™s an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	_ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // Import the MySQL driver
)

func main() {
	connectToMySQL()
}

func connectToMySQL() {
	// Connect to the database
	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/dbname")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error connecting to the database:", err)
	}
	defer db.Close() // Ensures the database connection is closed when the function exits

	fmt.Println("Connected to the database successfully!")

	// Perform database operations here
	// Example: Querying the database
	rows, err := db.Query("SELECT id, name FROM users")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal("Error querying the database:", err)
	}
	defer rows.Close() // Ensures the rows are closed after processing

	for rows.Next() {
		var id int
		var name string
		if err := rows.Scan(&id, &name); err != nil {
			log.Fatal("Error scanning row:", err)
		}
		fmt.Printf("User ID: %d, Name: %s\n", id, name)
	}
}
```

- Key Points:
1. **`defer db.Close()`**:
   - Ensures the database connection is closed when `connectToMySQL` exits, even if an error occurs during execution.

2. **`defer rows.Close()`**:
   - Ensures the result set (`rows`) is closed after processing, preventing resource leaks.

3. **Usage in Any Function**:
   - You can use `defer` in any function where cleanup tasks (like closing connections, files, or releasing resources) are required.

This approach ensures that resources are always released properly, making your code more robust and less prone to resource leaks.
