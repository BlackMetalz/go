### Concrete type
- Is a type that you can directly instantiate or create a value from.
- Examples of concrete types in Go include: int, bool, string, float64, arrays, slices, maps and structs...
- Interface types are abstract - they represent behavior or type but not a specific set of values
- Example:
```go
type Employee struct {
    Name string
    Age int
}

emp := Employee{Name: "kienlt", Age: 33}
```

### Interface type
- You declare an interface like `io.Reader`, you can not directly create an instance of io.Reader. Instead, you create instances of concrete types that satisfy the io.Reader interface.
```go
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```
