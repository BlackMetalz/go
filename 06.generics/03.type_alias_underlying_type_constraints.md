# Example for Alias and Underlying
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func AddI(a,b int) int {
	return a + b
}

func AddF(a,b float64) float64 {
	return a + b 
}

type myType interface {
	~int | ~float64
}

type myAlias int

// Format identifier[TypeName varType1|vartype2](s param) return_TypeName {code}
func AddT[T myType](a,b T) T {
	return a + b
}

func main() {
	var i myAlias = 10
	fmt.Println(AddI(1,2))
	fmt.Println(AddF(1.2,2.2))

	fmt.Println(AddT(i,2))
	fmt.Println(AddT(1.2,2.2))
}
```

Output:
```

# Example explain
In Go, the concepts of **underlying type** and **type alias** are important for understanding how custom types and type constraints work. Here's what they mean in the context of your code:

### **Underlying Type**
- The **underlying type** of a custom type is the type it is based on.
- In your code:
  ```go
  type myAlias int
  ```
  - `myAlias` is a custom type, and its **underlying type** is `int`.
  - This means `myAlias` behaves like an `int` in many ways, but it is treated as a distinct type unless explicitly converted.

- Similarly, in the `myType` interface:
  ```go
  type myType interface {
      ~int | ~float64
  }
  ```
  - The `~` operator means "any type whose underlying type is `int` or `float64`."
  - This allows types like `myAlias` (which has `int` as its underlying type) to satisfy the `myType` interface.

### **Type Alias**
- A **type alias** is when one type is declared as an alias for another type. This is done using the `=` syntax.
- Example (not in your code):
  ```go
  type MyInt = int
  ```
  - Here, `MyInt` is an alias for `int`. It is not a distinct type; it is exactly the same as `int`.

- In contrast, `myAlias` in your code is **not** a type alias; it is a new type with `int` as its underlying type.

### Key Differences:
| Concept            | Example                | Behavior                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Underlying Type** | `type myAlias int`     | Creates a new type with `int` as its underlying type.                   |
| **Type Alias**      | `type MyInt = int`     | Creates an alias; `MyInt` is treated exactly the same as `int`.         |

### How It Works in Your Code:
- The `myType` interface allows types like `int`, `float64`, or any custom type with `int` or `float64` as their underlying type (e.g., `myAlias`) to be used with the generic function `AddT`.
- This is why `AddT` works with both `myAlias` and `int`:
  ```go
  fmt.Println(AddT(i, 2))       // Works because myAlias has int as its underlying type
  fmt.Println(AddT(1.2, 2.2))  // Works because float64 satisfies myType
  ```
