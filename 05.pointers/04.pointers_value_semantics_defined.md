# Pointer value semantics (relating meaning of logic of pointer value?)
- Value semantics in Go refers to when the actual data of a variable is passed to a function or assigned to another variable. This means that the new variable or function parameter gets a completely independent copy of the data.

- Example:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Pointer semantics
// The function addOne takes a pointer to an integer as an argument and increments the value at that address by 1.
// This is an example of pointer semantics, where the function modifies the original value of the variable passed to it.
// This is useful when you want to modify the original value of a variable without returning it.
// In this case, the function addOne takes a pointer to an integer as an argument and increments the value at that address by 1.
func addOne(i *int) int {
	*i++
	return *i
}

//value Semantic
// The function addOneSemantic takes an integer as an argument and returns the integer incremented by 1.
func addOneSemantic(i int) int {
	return i +1
}

func main() {
	a := 1
	fmt.Println(a)
	addOne(&a)
	fmt.Println(a)

	// Semantic
	b := 1
	fmt.Println(b)
	addOneSemantic(b)
	fmt.Println(b)
	// The value of b is not changed because the function addOneSemantic does not modify the original value of b.
}
```

Output: Read the fucking code. No need to write output here xD
