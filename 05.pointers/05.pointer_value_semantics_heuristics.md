# Pointer & value semantics heuristics
1. Use value semantics when possible:
- If a function doesn't need to modify its input or the data you are working with is small (like built-in types or small structs), use value semantics.
- Value semantics are simpler and usually safer, since they don't involve shared state or require you to think about memory management.

2. Use pointer semantics for large data:
- Copying large structs or arrays can be inefficient.
- If the data you are working with is large, you might want to use pointer semantics to avoid the cost of copying the data. A rule of thumb: 64 bytes or larger, use pointers.

3. Use Pointer semantics for mutability:
- If a function or method needs to modify its receiver or an input parameter, you will need to use pointer semantics.
- THis is a common use case for methods that need to update the state of a struct.

4. Consistency:
- It's important to be consistent. If some functions on a type use pointer semantics and other use value semantics, it can lead to confusion. Typically, once a type has a method with pointer semantics, all methods on that type should have pointer semantics.

5. Pointer semantics when interfacing with other code:
- If you are interfacing with other code (like a library or system call), you might need to use pointer semantics. For example, the `json.Unmarshal` function in the Go standard library requires a pointer to a value to populate it with unmarshalled data.
