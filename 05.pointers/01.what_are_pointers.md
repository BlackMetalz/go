# What are pointers
All values are stored in memory
- post office boxes are a good analogy for memory
    - Every location in memory has an address
    - A pointer is a memory address
    - "Here's the value AND what is the address"

- Ambersand (&) give you address
- Astrix (*) give you value

- Code example: This will print the VALUE and ADDRESS of variable x
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 44
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Println(&x)

	fmt.Printf("%v\t%T\n", &x, &x) // 0xc000012110    *int (pointer to int)

	s := "Kienlt"
	fmt.Printf("%v\t%T\n", &s, &s) // 0xc000014050    *string (pointer to string)
}
```
