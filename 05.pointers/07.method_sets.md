# Theory:
- The method set of a type T consists of all methods with receiver type T.

- The method set of a type *T consists of all methods with receiver *T or T.

# Example #1:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type dog struct {
	 first string
}

func (d dog) walk() {
	fmt.Println("dog is walking: ", d.first)
}

func (d *dog) run() {
	d.first = "Halucan"
	fmt.Println("dog is running: ", d.first)
}

// This is not good for production
// we should use value receiver only or pointer receiver only
// but not both for the same struct
func main() {
	d1 := dog {
		first: "Henry",
	}
	d1.walk()
	d1.run()

	d2 := dog {
		first: "Hugo",
	}

	d2.walk()
	d2.run()
}
```

Output:
```
dog is walking:  Henry
dog is running:  Halucan
dog is walking:  Hugo
dog is running:  Halucan
```

# Example #2: Know 10% but still put here xD
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type dog struct {
	 first string
}

func (d dog) walk() {
	fmt.Println("dog is walking: ", d.first)
}

func (d *dog) run() {
	d.first = "Halucan"
	fmt.Println("dog is running: ", d.first)
}

type youngin interface {
	run()
	walk()
}

func youngrun(y youngin) {
	y.run()
}

func youngwalk(y youngin) {
	y.walk()
}

// This is not good for production
// we should use value receiver only or pointer receiver only
// but not both for the same struct
func main() {
	d1 := dog {
		first: "Henry",
	}
	d1.walk()
	d1.run()

	// youngrun(d1) // Not working, because d1 is a value receiver
	// youngrun(&d1) // Working, because d1 is a pointer receiver

	d2 := &dog {
		first: "Hugo",
	}

	d2.walk()
	d2.run()

	youngrun(d2)
	youngwalk(d2)
}
```

Output:
```
dog is walking:  Henry
dog is running:  Halucan
dog is walking:  Hugo
dog is running:  Halucan
dog is running:  Halucan
dog is walking:  Halucan
```
